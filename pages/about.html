            <h2>About Saint Petersburg</h2>
            <p>
                It is the second largest city of Russia and one of the world's major cities. St. Petersburg has played a
                vital role in
                Russian history since its founding in 1703. For two centuries (1712–1918) it was the capital of the
                Russian Empire.
            </p>
            <p>
                The city is often called "Venice of the North" because of its unique architecture. Petersburg is also
                very famous for
                its special creative atmosphere that attracts artists, poets, and dreamers.
            </p>

            <h3>Established</h3>
            <p>
                St. Petersburg was founded in 1703 by Peter the Great.
            </p>
            <p>
                The city’s beginnings were humble: only the Peter and Paul Fortress, designed by Swiss-Italian architect
                Domenico
                Trezzini, on the swampy land of Zayachy (Hare) Island near the mouth of the Neva River. The tsar himself
                helped to build
                the fortress.
            </p>


            <h3>Population</h3>
            <p>
                The last census in St. Petersburg was carried out in 2015. According to that census, the total
                population was 5,208,690.
